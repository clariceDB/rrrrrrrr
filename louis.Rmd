This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Install the required package for leiden from the relevant repo
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools"))
    install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/leiden")
```

Import relevant packages and specify correct python path - this might differ for people
```{r}
library("leiden")
library("tidygraph")
library("tidyverse")
library("igraph")
library("ggraph")
library("randomNames")
library("RColorBrewer")
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/local/lib/python3")
```

Read in the data and save as enron
```{r}
enron <- read_delim("email-enron-only.mtx",delim = " ",col_names = F) %>% 
  rename("from" = X1,
         "to" = X2) %>% 
  graph_from_data_frame()
```

```{r}
enron_tidy <- as_tbl_graph(enron)
```
convert to an adjacency matrix and from there create a graph project that will be plotted
```{r}
A <- as_adjacency_matrix(enron_tidy,type="both",names=TRUE,sparse=FALSE)
graph_object <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, mode = "directed")
plot(graph_object, vertex.color = "grey75")
```
This can be a shared nearest neighbours matrix derived from a graph object.
```{r}
adjacency_matrix <- igraph::as_adjacency_matrix(graph_object)
#adjacency_matrix <- tidygraph::as_adjacency_matrix(graph_object)
```

Then the Leiden algorithm can be run on the adjacency matrix.
```{r}
partition <- leiden(adjacency_matrix)
table(partition)
```
This shows partitions in the plotted results. The nodes that are more interconnected have been partitioned into separate clusters.
```{r}
library("RColorBrewer")
node.cols <- brewer.pal(max(c(3, partition)),"Pastel1")[partition]
plot(graph_object, vertex.color = node.cols)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
